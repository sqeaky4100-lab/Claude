This is an example file showing where to place your user export files.

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
1. Export user accounts from Active Directory:
   
   Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties DisplayName,EmailAddress,LastLogonDate,Enabled |
       Select-Object Name,SamAccountName,DisplayName,EmailAddress,LastLogonDate,Enabled |
       Export-Csv "users-export-2024-02-11.csv" -NoTypeInformation

2. Place the CSV file in this directory (data/user-exports/)

3. Ask Claude questions like:
   "Review the user export at data/user-exports/users-export-2024-02-11.csv
    and identify any inactive accounts that should be disabled."

4. Claude will analyze the data and provide recommendations

You can delete this example file once you understand the workflow.
